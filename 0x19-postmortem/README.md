A postmortem on the Microsoft Global Outage on July 19, 2024


Issue Summary


Duration: The outage lasted approximately 4 hours, starting at 10:00 AM PST and ending at 2:00 PM PST.

Impact: The outage affected a wide range of Microsoft services, including Microsoft 365 (Office 365, Teams, Outlook, SharePoint), Azure cloud services, and other internal tools. Millions of users worldwide experienced service disruptions, including slow performance, intermittent connectivity, and complete service outages.

Root Cause: The primary cause of the outage was a software update from CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor threat-monitoring software, which caused crashes in Microsoft's Windows operating system. This led to a chain reaction that disrupted various Microsoft services.


Timeline
- 10:00 AM PST: Initial reports of service disruptions start coming in from users.
- 10:30 AM PST: Microsoft's monitoring systems detect widespread service outages.
- 11:00 AM PST: The incident is escalated to the highest levels within Microsoft, and a team of engineers is assembled to investigate the root cause.
- 12:00 PM PST: Initial investigations lead to a focus on network infrastructure issues.
- 1:00 PM PST: The root cause is identified as a software update conflict with CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor.
- 1:30 PM PST: A fix is deployed, and services begin to recover.
- 2:00 PM PST: All services are fully restored.


Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the outage was a software update conflict between Microsoft's Windows operating system and CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor threat-monitoring software. The update introduced a compatibility issue that caused Windows to crash, leading to a cascade of failures across Microsoft's services.
To resolve the issue, Microsoft engineers identified and isolated the faulty update. They then deployed a fix to disable the incompatible component of the update, allowing Windows to function normally and restoring service to affected users.


Corrective and Preventative Measures

Corrective Measures:
- Update compatibility testing: Implement more rigorous testing procedures for software updates to identify and address potential conflicts before deployment.
- Monitoring enhancements: Improve monitoring capabilities to detect and alert on software update-related issues more promptly.
- Incident response procedures: Review and refine incident response procedures to ensure a more efficient and effective response to future outages.


Preventative Measures:
- Software update management: Establish a more robust software update management process, including regular patching and security updates.
- Dependency analysis: Conduct regular dependency analysis to identify potential conflicts between software components.
- Disaster recovery planning: Strengthen disaster recovery plans to ensure a rapid recovery from future outages.

Specific Tasks:
- Patch CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor: Apply a patch to address the compatibility issue with Windows.
- Update monitoring rules: Modify monitoring rules to detect similar software update conflicts in the future.
- Conduct postmortem analysis: Conduct a detailed postmortem analysis to identify lessons learned and inform future improvements.
- Implement new testing procedures: Develop and implement new testing procedures for software updates.
- Review incident response procedures: Review and update incident response procedures to address the lessons learned from this outage.
